<p><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>How is the game played?</font></font>
<p><font size=+1>Click with the mouse on the piece you want to move to
and then on the square you want to put it on. Picking is obligatory, so
if you have the possibility to pick with one piece, you are not allowed
to move another instead of picking.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The computer is your opponent. You&nbsp; will have to
wait for a few seconds for it to think out its respondent&nbsp; move. How
long you are going to wait and how clever the computer is going to be depends
on the level of difficulty you have chosen from the menu Level.</font>
<p><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>Rules:</font></font>
<p><font size=+1>You have the right to move only diagonally. Picking is
possible only when you hop your opponent's piece. You can pick in a chain,
that is to say, you can successively hop a few pieces for a move.</font>
<p><font size=+1>When you reach the last line your pawn will become a king.
This is not a big deal, because he is a pawn like all the others, only
that apart from moving forward it can also move backwards. Unlike the king,
the pawn can move only forward, but it can pick from all directions.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The aim of the game is to mop up all pieces of your opponent.
If some of the players is blocked and cannot make any move then the game
is draw.</font>
<p><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>History</font></font>
<p><font size=+1>Checkers is a game almost as famous as Chess. World championships
are organised and world champions are distinguished. It is interesting
that Checkers is easier for the computer than Chess. People have been losing
from the computer when playing this game from many years, and, until&nbsp;
recently a computer called Deep Blue has been created and it defeated the
Chess world champion.</font>
<p><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>Authors</font></font>
<p><font size=+1>This program has been written by Borislav Rizov (computer
science&nbsp; student at the University of Sofia). With it he won the competition
of Strawberry Prolog for game of the millennium. The author of this manual
is Dimiter Dobrev.</font>
<p><font color="#CC0000"><font size=+2>Good Luck</font></font>
<p><font size=+1>We wish you to have fun with this game and if you lose,
it means that you either have bought a too good computer, or, the reason
is in the one who grins at you from the mirror. In both cases- don't lose
heart.</font>
